<!-- Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/) focusing on routing for multi-agent systems. I proudly earned my Ph.D. degree in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) under Professor [Jie Fu](https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/) in December 2022. My research interests include reinforcement learning, stochastic optimal control, game theory, motion planning, and formal methods.

I received a B.S. degree in Computer Science and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2014. Then, I obtained a M.S. degree in Computer Science in May 2016 under Professor [Michael A. Gennert](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~michaelg/) from WPI. Also, I gained another M.S. degree in Robotics Engineering in May 2021 under Professor Jie Fu from WPI. -->

I am proud to have earned my Ph.D. in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in December 2022, under the guidance of Professor [Jie Fu](https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/). My research interests are diverse and include reinforcement learning, stochastic optimal control, game theory, motion planning, and formal methods.

In 2014, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and my B.A. degree in English Language and Literature from Harbin Institute of Technology, China. Following that, I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science under the mentorship of Professor [Michael A. Gennert](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~michaelg/) at WPI, which I completed in May 2016. I continued my academic journey and earned another Master's degree in Robotics Engineering in May 2021 under the guidance of Professor Jie Fu from WPI.

Overall, my academic background and professional experience have equipped me with a diverse skill set, allowing me to make valuable contributions in the field of robotics engineering.
