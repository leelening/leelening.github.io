I am a Ph.D. in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) under Professor [Jie Fu](https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/). I received a B.S. degree in Computer Science and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2014. After that, I obtained two Master's degrees in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science in May 2021 under Professor Jie Fu and May 2016 under Professor [Michael A. Gennert](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~michaelg/) from WPI.
