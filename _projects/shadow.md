title: Serial Interactions in Imperfect Information Games Applied to Complex Military Decision Making (SI3-CMD)
---

Serial Interactions in Imperfect Information Games Applied to Complex Military Decision Making (SI3-CMD) builds on recent developments in artificial intelligence and game theory to enable more effective decisions in adversarial domains. SI3-CMD will explore several military decision making applications at strategic, tactical, and operational levels and develop AI/game theory techniques appropriate for their problem characteristics. These applications will extend current AI/game theory techniques to be effective when there are multiple interacting agents, extremely large search spaces, sequential revelation of information, use of deception, continuous resource quantities, stochastic outcomes, and the ability to learn from past iterations. The program will produce new techniques and assessments of their effectiveness for military uses.
